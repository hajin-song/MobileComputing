##Brief
*Fit to the brief: Does it address the brief in a creative way? Does it fulfil a real need, solve a real problem or explore a real opportunity? Is it supporting active decision-making? Is the application likely to lead to a safer future? Fully addresses a major safety- related problem with a substantially innovative solution. Solution has commercial or research potential.*   

 People rely on different sources for urgent news, but typically it's by word-of-mouth. Natural hazards, mass shootings, and building fires are all such news that are usually known by interaction with people. 

According to Sensis' social media survey in 2016, Social media 

In an emergency, p

##Research
User Research: Did the team follow a user-centred design process? Did they go out and interview users other than students?  
Our focus was to address the enhancement of emergency awareness.



###Process
Because the problem space is undefined by a certain location or lifestyle, and due to the sporadic nature of urgent news, methods like ethnographies did not fit our research process. 

####Interviews

1- Have you ever been harmed by an event such as a natural disaster or a building fire, that could have been evaded?  
2- What sort of events are you afraid might happen to you, or your properties?  
3- If existing, can you relate an emergency situation that happened nearby you and describe how did you first learn of it?    
4- Describe your social media life/usage.   
5- How do you usually learn of urgent local news that are safety related? (Such as fires and traffic incidents)?  
6- What sort of technology would you wish for to be up to date with all urgent local news?  


-----
1- Can you describe the process of relaying an urgent message to the masses of a recent event?  
2- How effective is the current alert system?  
3- What sort of technology would you wish for to facilitate mass communication?



---
1- Throughout your career, what sort of events could have led to lesser casualties if communication was enhanced?

2- Can you describe the process of relaying an urgent message to the masses of a recent event? Even if through facilitators.

3- How effective is the current alert system?

4- What sort of technology would you wish for to facilitate mass communication?
#####Interview 1
**Subject:** X yrs old male.  
**Occupation:** Firefighter.  
**Location:** Melbourne Suburb.  
**What are the most challenging events as a firefighter?**  
**How do you think is the best way to communicate with the people living in an area of impact of an urgent event?**  



#####Interview 2
**Subject:** X yrs old female, has a car.  
**Occupation:** .  
**Location:** Melbourne.  
**How do you know about news the first time?**  
**What would you do first if you see something interesting?**   
**What’s your news source for emergency events?**  
**Has there been any event that you encountered but don’t know its explanation?**

#####Interview 3
**Subject:** X yrs old female, has a car.  
**Occupation:** .  
**Location:** Melbourne.  
**How do you know about news the first time?**  
**What would you do first if you see something interesting?**   
**What’s your news source for emergency events?**  
**Has there been any event that you encountered but don’t know its explanation?**

###Resolution
Basically, there are number of alert systems in place already (BoM, Federal Gov. Sites, Police SNS, etc.)
But it’s rather annoying to access all of them in different places.
So we are building an application that will pull those data into single place + more (twitter event mining/user provided contents)

-  User Experience: How is the usability of the application? Does it make good use of aesthetic design principles?
